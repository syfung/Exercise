""" CSC148 Exercise 7

Joshua Fung
June 30th, 2015

Four Functions:
rsum: Return sum
rmax: Return max
second_smallest: Return second smallest
sum_max_min: Return the sum of max and min

The different of this exercise than exercise_6 is that instead of
working with a single list of intergers it needs to work with a
combination of nested list and list.

For example:
[1, 2, 3]
[1, [2, 3]]
[[1], [2, [3]], [1]]

# For now we will start with coping the old code form ex6.py
